How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I really found it beneficial to develop code in this step by step way. It is such a time saver to be able to call back on a previously coded module. This is a great advantage if created in a general/flexible way in which you could utilize for other scenarios. For instance, this CRUD module can be used on any database.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Currently, I approach such problems by seeking resources and asking questions, as I am new to all of this information. However, this has taught me to work meticulously and step by step, as each issue caught saves us time and frustration down the road. This was my typical method of progressing through this course, and I feel I will take some good lessons with me regarding best pracices, and an attention to detail, especially when first discussing the design plans with the client.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists bridge the gap between the user and the technology. They can "speak the language", so to speak, and work to solve technical issues in order to provide a desired user outcome or experience. considering how prevelent technology is, this is an important role. The work I completed for this project would help Grazioso do his work better by providing him with a simple, efficient interface to utilize for searching for different types of rescue dogs in a given location.
